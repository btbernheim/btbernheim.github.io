		<p align="center">If you're visiting this website, you're probably ready to switch up or diet and excercise regimen. Diet and exercise are the foundations of fitness. This page will provide you with some new suggestions to help you switch up your workout and get the most out of your diet.</p>
	<h2 align="center">What Are Your Goals?</h2>
	<p>Setting goals are the single most important step in your fitness regimen. Without them, you would have no direction or way to ensure your progression. Let's say for example, that your goal is to gain <em>5 lbs.</em> What would you need to do to achieve this goal?</p>
	<p>To begin, create a resistance training regimen using these tools:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dumbells</li>
		<li>Barbells</li>
		<li>Resistance Machines</li>
		<li>Body Movements</li>
	<p>Many novice weight lifters jump right into heavy lifting once they enter the gym</p>
	</ul>
		<ol>
		<li>Warm your body up with dynamic stretching</li>
		<li>Begin your weight training with a compound movement</li>
		<li>Cooldown with some light cardio and stretching</li>
	</ol>
