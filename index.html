		<p align="center">If you're visiting this website, you're probably ready to switch up your diet and excercise regimen. Diet and exercise are the foundations of fitness. This page will provide you with some new suggestions to help you switch up your workout and get the most out of your diet.</p>

	<h2 align="center">What Are Your Goals?</h2>
	<p>Goal setting is the single most important step in your fitness regimen. Without them, you would have no direction or way to ensure your progression. Let's say for example, that your goal is to gain <em>5 lbs.</em> What would you need to do to achieve this goal?</p>
	<p><strong>Back To Basics:</strong> Resistance training regimens are comprised of four main tools:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dumbells</li>
		<li>Barbells</li>
		<li>Resistance Machines</li>
		<li>Body Weight Movements</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Many novice weight lifters jump right into heavy lifting once they enter the gym. This increases your chances of injury while training. To prevent injuries, follow these steps:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Warm your body up with dynamic stretching</li>
		<li>Begin your weight training with a compound movement</li>
		<li>Cooldown with some light cardio and stretching</li>
	</ol>

	<p>What did you like: The overall content of the site is extremely well organized and provides complete and detailed information. The topics are divided into clear sections and overall organization leaves a very aesthetic finish. The tables are interactive, providing links to clarify what is meant by each cell, these type of links can be seen throughout the page, making it very user-friendly. The page also includes video tutorials, which is something I was looking into while building my  site. What didn't you like: The page seems to be divided in half, where all the true content is on the left, and the right has ads and other links. After scrolling down a bit, the links and adds stop, leaving the entire right side of the page blank. This seems like an unnecessary waste of space and causes the website to be much longer than it needs to be.</p>
